Preparing for this exercise of drawing my letter using a grid, I got myself a nice, sharp drawing pen – a Uni-ball air – and a 5-mm-quad exercise book – a 1J5. I am in two minds as to whether this was a good combination. On the one hand, the paper of the book was thin and the ink of the pen was very liquid, so I wasted quite a few pages as ink bled through from the page I was drawing on to the page beneath. However, the ink only spread slightly on the page itself, giving the pen lines a quite lovely sketchy quality. I had an idea that I would recreate my sketches pixel-perfect in Illustrator, but it quickly became apparent that the sketches contained too much character that would be lost.

Starting then with an 8×8 grid, my G came together quite easily, with these three versions showing how easy it is to get a very nicely formed G from a few pixels:

Interestingly, my instinctive forms using a grid are quite different from the 8-bit arcade font version:

<img alt="grid 4" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/grid-4.jpg" class="small-img">

I guess an important difference is that the arcade font is actually on a 7×7 grid, given that it includes its own spacing. Perhaps the big difference is that I am drawing mine 4 cm tall, whereas the arcade font is intended to be seen 1 cm tall or smaller.

To create an abstract version, I took the second of my formal attempts and 'exploded' the curve, but kept the chin intact (to ensure it was still a recognisable G). It makes a very nice counterpart to the non-exploded version.

Taking the idea that retaining the chin retains the essense of the G, combined with my idea that the chin can take the form of an arrowhead, I stripped my G back to the following. While this only uses a portion of the grid, the location of the arrow in the overall grid is meaningful.

But, I wasn't done creating straight Gs out of the grid. I gave some thought to trying to get serifs on my forms, but felt that would probably be unsatisfying. So instead I tried adding modulation to the strokes. Starting with the third of my original forms, I pumped up the vertical strokes, creating some wonderful new forms. The last one also looks great unfilled.

Step 2 in the exercise is to draw my letter with straight or curved lines, rather then pixels, while still being constrained by the grid. I have to admit to a bit of a failure of imagination here, especially compared to some of the inspired examples shown off by my class mates. I gave it a shot though. Here a few examples of what came up with.

<img alt="grid 11" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/grid-11.jpg" class="small-img"> <img alt="grid 12" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/grid-12.jpg" class="small-img"> <img alt="grid 13" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/grid-13.jpg" class="small-img">

Finally, we are let loose to create a large-scale letterform using a technique of our choosing, while retainining a modular aspect, exploring texture or a 3D quality.

While building my pixelated forms, I had given some thought as to how they might scale up, without changing the resolution of the grid. I had in mind that the larger pixels could become smoothed out, making them flow together like drops. And building this, I found that it achieved exactly that.

However, a preliminary draft I used to get to my create this form displayed a fantastic sketchy yet technical character that I really loved. This is perhaps my favourite form so far.

The suggestion of a 3D quality appealed, as I thought it might work very well with the modular aspect. I had in mind the G disappearing to a vanishing point (or to a much smaller base), like a giant cylinder. Trying to put that down, I found an interesting effect. Without shading, which I'm not really skilled enough to apply, the big curve of the G doesn't really look 3D, while the chin and the top end of the curve do. This has the interesting effect of letting the bare letter form stand out, with the lines heading giving the some structure.
