With a piece of chalk in hand, I attempted to draw a G without looking at the paper. I don't think I can honestly say I didn't look. Dragging the chalk across the card kept shifting the card around, and I couldn't help but look to see where the card was going. So my forms all turned out very clean. I produced three Gs; the first trying to create a plain sans serif form, the second adding serifs and stroke modulation and in the third, for which I abandoned all efforts to not look, I put pressure on the inner side of the curve to try to get a gradient of strength in the chalk marks.



Next, drawing the blackletter version of my G with chalk. Firstly I tried to draw the blackletter G with a series of single strokes using the chalk on its edge. In this way, I could certainly manage the letter, but the medium is not the best way to write blackletter. It really needs a calligraphy pen or much greater skill with chalk. I did want to see what the letter looked like as chalk on black card, so I did a more careful rendering.



Next, the idea is to draw the letter using negative space. The approach demonstrated by my classmates in the workshop was to form the letter by drawing and colouring around the lettershape, creating a background for the letter to sit on. My understanding of negative space is different however. I see negative space as the space between shapes, not simply an inverse. I attempted this in two separate ways. Firstly I formed the G shape within a feathery texture. Then I more clearly implemented by interpreation of negative space, drawing shapes that surround a blank space that takes a G shape. I tried not to make the space too clearly G-shaped.



Forming a positive form then. I applied a concept that connected with my last negative space effort. Here I formed the positive shape by a number of smaller shapes, which coming together madea a clear G.



The last exercise in the workshop involved forming the letter out of geometric shapes, which I had in done in my last picture. In this one however, I ensured I only used the edge of my chalk, to get the full effect of the texture of the chalk.



Then, as a palate cleanser, returning to the first exercise, drawing a G without looking, using the long edge of a piece of chalk. I didn't really want to repeat what I had did earlier, so I took my shortest piece of chalk. Quickly tossing off my normal hand written G:
