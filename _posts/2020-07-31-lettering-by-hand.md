With a piece of chalk in hand, I attempted to draw a G without looking at the paper. I don't think I can honestly say I didn't look. Dragging the chalk across the card kept shifting the card around, and I couldn't help but check to see where the card was going. So my forms all turned out very clean. I produced three Gs; the first trying to create a plain sans serif form, the second adding serifs and stroke modulation and in the third, for which I abandoned all efforts to not look, I put pressure on the inner side of the curve to try to get a gradient of strength in the chalk marks.

Next, drawing the blackletter version of my G with chalk. Firstly I tried to draw the blackletter G with a series of single strokes using the chalk on its edge. In this way, I could certainly manage the letter, but the medium is not the best for writing blackletter. It really needs a calligraphy pen or much greater skill with chalk. I did want to see what the letter looked like as chalk on black card, so I did a more careful rendering.

Next, the idea was to draw the letter using negative space. The approach demonstrated by my classmates in the workshop was to form the letter by drawing and colouring around the lettershape, creating a background for the letter to sit on. My understanding of negative space is different however. I see negative space as the space formed between shapes, not simply an inverse. I attempted this in two different ways. Firstly I formed the G shape within a feathery texture. Then I more clearly implemented my interpreation of negative space, drawing shapes that surround a blank space, thinking of slices or perhaps the view though the gaps in a vertical grid.

Drawing a positive form, then. I took a cue from my last negative space effort and formed the positive shape from a number of smaller shapes, which coming together made a clear G.

The last proper exercise in the workshop involved forming the letter out of geometric shapes â€“ which I had kind of done in my last drawing. In this one however, I drew the shapes making up the letter in a different way, using only the edge of my chalk, to get the full effect of the texture of the chalk.

Then, as a palate cleanser, we returned to the first exercise, drawing a G without looking, using the long edge of a piece of chalk. I didn't really want to repeat what I  did earlier, so I took my shortest piece of chalk. Quickly scrawling my normal handwritten G I got:

I was quite surprised to see how different my handwritten G looked from the Gs I had drawn (apart from the one directly above). In drawing G in all the exercises up to this point, I had been more influenced by Gs in formal typefaces and had not considered what my own written G looked like.
