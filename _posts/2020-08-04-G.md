So, the letter I have been given is G.

Hmm. This will be interesting. It will be tricky, but interesting because it is tricky.

Of all the letters in the alphabet, I think I understand G the least in terms of its architecture. The largest portion of a G is the C-like curve. But then, at the bottom end of the curve, it has a ... a foot? ... an elbow? ... some combination of strokes. I'm not even sure how I write it myself when I am not thinking about what I am doing.

Examining what it looks like in a variety of fonts:

So clearly, a typical G is a C-like curve with a horinzontal bar at its lower end, possibly with a vertical bar down to the baseline. Of these examples, I feel that the Century Schoolbook example would be the canonical shape. However, I'm very intrigued by the curved-arrow shape of the Helvetica G. I would really like to come across a more symmetical example of that form.

A quick look at the history of G helps to explain the shape a bit. It appears that G was a modification of C in the Roman alphabet. C came to Roman from the Greek letter gamma Œì, which itself came from the Phoenician letter gimel ê°Ç, possibly named for its resemblance to a camel's hump, being shaped like an upsidedown v. In Roman, C ‚Äì now shaped as we recognise it in the modern alphabet ‚Äì came to be used for both hard-g and k sounds. To differentiate the two sounds, the new letter G was invented by adding a slight inward curve to the bottom of the C, which in time evolved to the bar in the modern form of the letter. Cool.
