So, a couple of weeks have passed since the date of my last post, and the assignment is due tomorrow. There is a lot to catch up on and distill for this blog.

A lot of the work for the poster and for the zine has been happening only in my head. Planning I suppose you could call it, but it also involves finding some clarity within my ideas and removing doubt about what I am doing.

One important consideration was the text that I was going to use. I wanted it to be very *G-ey*. And the part of my brain still clinging to my old physics background immediately thought of the gravitational constant from Newton's equation of gravitational force. It is hard to get more fundamental than the defining constant for one of the foundational forces in the universe. As usual, Wikipedia was a great source for an explanation for gravitational constant G. I took the introductory paragraphs and editing them down somewhat:

> The gravitational constant, denoted by the letter *G*, is an empirical physical constant in Sir Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
>
> In Newton’s law, *G* is the proportionality constant connecting the gravitational force between two bodies with the product of their masses and the inverse square of their distance. In the Einstein field equations, *G* quantifies the relation between the geometry of spacetime and the energy–momentum tensor (also referred to as the stress–energy tensor).
>
> The measured value of *G* is known with some certainty to four significant digits. In SI units its value is approximately 6.674 × 10<sup>−11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>.
>
> The modern notation of *G* as the gravitational constant was introduced in the 1890s by C. V. Boys. The first implicit measurement with an accuracy within about 1% is attributed to Henry Cavendish in a 1798 experiment.
