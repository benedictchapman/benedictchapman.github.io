So, a couple of weeks have passed since the date of my last post, and the assignment is due tomorrow. There is a lot to catch up on and distill for this blog.

A lot of the work for the poster and for the zine has been happening only in my head. Planning I suppose you could call it, but it also involves finding some clarity within my ideas and removing doubt about what I am doing.

One important consideration was the text that I was going to use. I wanted it to be very *G-ey*. And the part of my brain still clinging to my old physics background immediately thought of the gravitational constant from Newton's equation of gravitational force. It is hard to get more fundamental than the defining constant for one of the foundational forces in the universe. As usual, Wikipedia was a great source for an explanation for the gravitational constant G. I took the introductory paragraphs and edited them down somewhat.

(Although the poster and zine won't be published, to give the authors of the piece I adapted from Wikipedia their due respect, my source is [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant), which is protected by [this licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License). I have used the first four paragraphs and have simplified the text.)

> The gravitational constant, denoted by the letter *G*, is an empirical physical constant in Sir Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
>
> In Newton’s law, *G* is the proportionality constant connecting the gravitational force between two bodies with the product of their masses and the inverse square of their distance. In the Einstein field equations, *G* quantifies the relation between the geometry of spacetime and the energy–momentum tensor.
>
> The measured value of *G* is known with some certainty to four significant digits. In SI units its value is approximately 6.674 × 10<sup>−11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>.
>
> The modern notation of *G* as the gravitational constant was introduced in the 1890s by C. V. Boys. The first implicit measurement with an accuracy within about 1% is attributed to Henry Cavendish in a 1798 experiment.

That should work fine. Depending on how you count things, it comes to about 136 words.

Now, fairly early on, in the grid workshop, I generated a very smart G:

I thought this was a lovely form and would look great as a large image. I had been sketching a poster with this G in my mind. However, in the last drawing workshop, I stumbled on an amazing letterform. It was bold and interesting, and abstract yet very articulate. Perfect for the poster.

So, I created an InDesign document and imported the G image file. I made only a minor edit to the G image, making it taller so I had the freedom to move the position of the G up or down on the page.

According to the brief for the assigment, the poster needed a title, my name and my text. Due to the monumental scale of the G image, there was not much room for the text. As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time fiddling with the size, shape and positioning of the text and the title, to make it work on the page and ensure it is balanced. Most of this work doesn't bear a detailed explanation. A couple of things that could be noted, however, are the fact that I wanted to avoid splitting the second paragraph over the two columns and that there are some unfortunate hyphens. I don't know enough about text manipulation to avoid the hyphens without creating worse ones, though I tried quite hard.

I am so very pleased with this poster. I could almost imagine it being displayed in a university physics department or in a museam, as part of a description of the fundamental physical constants. There is also an unforseen metaphorical aspect to it. The shape of the G image and the texture of the chalk make the G look quite a lot like a full moon, and the speckles of chalk dust make the background look a little like a starscape in the night sky. I think this is very appropriate as the text deals with gravity.
