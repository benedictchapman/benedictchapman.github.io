And that leaves the zine.

Naturally enough, compiling the zine involved identifying my favourite drawings (with some assistance from my children), adding them to the document and fitting the text around them. That is easy to say, but there were of course a million and one choices involved, very few of which I can actually put into words. But I will try to express my broader thoughts.

There was a great variety in the images of Gs that came together from the workshops. I wanted to use that fact by creating a sense of surprise through the pages of the zine. Each page has a design that relies just on the image on that page, so could be very different from the previous page.

There were some consistencies in my design choices. Notably, the typeface for the text is the same throughout, Proxima Nova, with the colour, weight, position and alignment being dicated by the image it appears with. The point size of the text is also consistent apart from the cover.

Those things that change are dependent on the image on that page. In many ways my choices were made because they *feel right*, but there were some definite conscious considerations, which I'll try to outline.

* The image on the home page is one that I had identified as being a possible display image, and was very nearly used for the poster. It illustrates a work in progress of creating a letter form, so perhaps emphasises the fact that the images within the zine are handmade. The thin lines of the image called for either a contrasting heavy font (and I briefly considered using Cooper Black) or a complementary thin font.
* The image on the first page has something of a *hero* quality to it â€“ bringing to mind Superman perhaps, making it appropriate for the introdcutory page. The text is similarly introductory. They both needed their space and are arranged accordingly.
* The blackletter G on page 3 is one of the best formed letters in my work, so deserves to be shown full size. This left no room for text, so I placed it over the image, with a blue stroke to make it legible but also to emphsise its separation from the image. The letterform has a balance around its central vertical axis point, so I gave the text the same structure by centring it.
* The centerpeice of the zine is a large, wide letterform. I considered expanding the black of the image off the page, but it really needs its own natural edge to make it a proper G. The text here is placed as a counter to the T-shaped chin and is justified to match the many right angles in the rest of the page.
* The relative thin shape of the next letter made it difficult to have it fill enough space on the page while still allowing text to fit. So I overlapped the space for the text and for the letter image, and flowed the text around the image, in a technique that I had not used on any of the other pages.
* To match the squares used on the next page, the text was set in a block of equal sides and justified.
* The back cover features a series of letterforms I quite liked. I also thought the progression from thin to excessively thick was amusing and therefore a good way to finish the zine.

So there it is. A poster and zine complete, and very nearly this blog. I really love this feeling of being done with a piece of design, when all the inperceptible changes and nudges have finally produced something you are happy with, and each time you look over the work looking for errors become another excuse to admire what you have done. It is this feeling of satisfaction that drives my desire to be a designer.
