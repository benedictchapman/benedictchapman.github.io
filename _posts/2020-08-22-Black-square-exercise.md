Our first directive for creating our letter form is to do it with a combination of four black squares on a white background. As I had suspected, my letterform is a challenge. Firstly, it is mostly a curve, and squares are inherintly non-curvy. Then, the G's foot thing adds more complexity, requiring its own black squares and being a very different kind of shape from the curve.
