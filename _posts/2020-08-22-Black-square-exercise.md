Our first directive for creating our letter form is to do it with a combination of four black squares on a white background. As I had suspected, my letterform is a challenge. Firstly, it is mostly a curve, and squares are inherently non-curvy. Then, the G's foot thing adds more complexity, requiring its own black squares and being a very different kind of shape from the curve.

My first thought was regarding the arrow-head shape of the foot that I had seen in the Helvetica G. (Actually, I had pictured this before checking to see what a G looks like in Helvetica. I am sure I have seen Gs with shapes like that, but at any rate, it doesn't take that much imagination.) The angle of the arrow head could easily be the apex of a square, so consequently a single square could be an abstraction of the foot of the G.

So with the three remaining squares, I would have to form an abstracted curve, ensuring that the curve worked with the square representing the foot.

Despite my comments above, a passable curve in not hard to form. I started with forming the curve with three largish squares and then the foot with a smaller square. It looked G-ish, if rather ugly.

Using smaller squares worked much better.

I tried a somewhat similar approach but using the orientation to indicate what role the square was playing and found a combination that really appealed to me.

Moving away from the idea of portioning three squares for the curve and one for the foot, I abstracted the curve using just two large squares:

Cropping can help emphasise the shape.

Finally I wanted to see what I could do about creating a more accurate form for the foot, which I could achieve by using negative space and relying on the boundaries of the background

This was a fun excercise. The brief was to create just three, so these are my three favourte of my efforts:
