In a bit of a surprise, getting the design brief I am going to work on is not as straight forward as I thought it was going to be. It turns out that we are not being paired up with another classmate and simply being assigned their design project. We have been put into groups of three and have to work out ourselves which design we would work on.

It was all very easy to sort out however. We connected during class and then communicated by WhatsApp, exchanging briefs, and had a quick Zoom meeting. In my group were Kate and Yisha, and their projects were, respectively, a redesign of Lush’s logo and Planty, a hypothetical app for identifying and caring for plants. I had no particular preference for either. It was Kate’s love of plants that got us organised however. With Kate taking Yisha’s, Yisha took mine and I took Kate’s Lush brief.

## Brief for redesign of Lush’s logo

The brief I received from Kate is for a redesign of Lush’s logo. Here is my summary of what is contained in the brief.

* Lush is a cosmetics company. Their products are handmade (whatever that means in this context), ethical, environmentally friendly and use fresh ingredients (again, probably open to interpretation).
* Lush has few competitors in the eco-friendly, ethical cosmetics field, though this is likely to change. Their current competitors include The Body Shop and Kiehl’s, most notably. However, the number of smaller producers using direct ecommerce platforms is growing.
* Lush’s point of difference is its six values: using fresh ingredients, being 100% vegetarian, ethical buying, handmade products, naked packaging and fighting animal testing.
* Lush’s primary audience is 20–30-year-old women with disposible income, though Lush deliberately do not target women or men specifically in their marketing.
* Lush do not use traditional advertising, as a policy.
* Lush want their logo redesigned with a softer look. Currently, Lush’s branding style is bold, both in colour and in font choice. The new design should be more approachable and less loud, and it should work with a softer palette. It needs to capture Lush’s values. In addition, it should be welcoming and present a “casual, helpful earthy and approachable tone”.
* The logo will be used on store signage, on product packaging and online. It needs to be print and web friendly.
* The current logo and wordmark are indeed bold. In both, “Lush” is displayed in all-caps Helvetica, in a weight beyond ‘bold’. In the samples provided “Fresh handmade cosmetics” is included in both the logo and wordmark, in all-caps and in a font that resembles handwritten marker and bold Helvetica, respectively. (Samples included below.)
* The new logo should not follow the stereotype for organic-themed brands of using green or featuring plant life, while still demonstrating that they are ethical.
* The logo should contribute to helping users feel guilt-free in pampering themselves with Lush’s products. They should have confidence that Lush’s products are both friendly to the environment and their own bodies.
* Kate provides a series of references demonstrating Lush’s current branding and business practices, as well as some articles discussing the business of ethical cosmetics.

## Research and analysis

First off, Lush’s logo is definitely bold. At a glance, there is nothing in the logo that expresses their core values. And there is nothing in the logo that suggests what their products are. I am at a loss as to its appeal. Kate is absolutely right in thinking that this logo needs to be redesigned.

Secondly, looking through Lush’s website and other references online, I think what Kate has identified as Lush’s logo is actually an old logo, and that what Kate refers to as the wordmark is the current logo for the company. This simplifies things somewhat. My objective then is to design a replacement for the current Lush wordmark/logo, to produce a new wordmark/logo that satisfies the requirements of Kate’s brief.

My first bit of research was, of course, to examine Lush’s website. Then I referred to websites of Lush’s competitors. I was sceptical of Kate’s claim that Lush does not have many direct competitors, though looking around the web, I think she’s right with respect to the global market. Her point that small home-based producers proliferate via direct ecommerce is also almost certainly spot on. However, my research shows that there appears to be a large number of producers between these poles. These are smaller producers, who may or may not even have a global presence, but who don’t rely on direct ecommerce. They are sold in homeware stores and supermarkets and in dedicated ‘ethical’ stores (here I am thinking of Good House Keeping at the top of Cuba St, but there are many examples). Some even have their own stores, such as Wellington Apothecary. So Lush doesn't have to distinguish itself just from its direct competitors, The Body Shop and Kiehl’s, but also the numerous smaller brands, either because some of them may one day grow to challenge Lush in size or because of the competition they present as a collective.

Here are some links to other cosmetic firms in Lush's ecosystem:

* [The Body Shop](https://nz.lush.com)
* [Kiehl’s](https://www.kiehls.com)
* [Ethique](https://ethiqueworld.com)
* [Wellington Apothecary](https://www.wellingtonapothecary.co.nz)
* [Bottega Organica](https://www.bottegaorganica.com)
* [Wabi-Sabi](https://wabisabibotanicals.com)

One thing that struck me about the styles of many of these brands is how typographic their wordmarks are. This is apparent in some of the examples I listed above, but is stronger in the smaller companies without good web presences. I feel that this is perhaps influenced by two things. Firstly, traditional cosmetic companies – I’m thinking L’Oreal here – use quite stark wordmarks, which may be an enduring influence on the whole field. Secondly, many of the small producers tend towards a very tidy, hand-crafted aesthetic, typified most clearly by the use of undyed cardboard in their packaging, and I think a fairly un-fussy wordmark suits that aesthetic nicely. A stand-out exception to this is Ethique, which has a wordmark that looks hand-drawn.

## Initial design thoughts

An approach that I am considering is to use a hand-drawn wordmark, making an effort to make it distinct from other examples in the field, Ethique specifically. This will go a long way towards making the logo softer and more approachable. I am also quite inspired by the photos of products from the Lush website. There is a lot of *roundness* on the page – the bath bombs (my first association when I think of Lush) and the blobs of shower gell or body lotion – that I would like to incorporate into my design.
