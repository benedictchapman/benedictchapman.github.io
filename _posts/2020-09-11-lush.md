In a bit of a surprise, getting the design brief I am going to work on is not as straight forward as I thought it was going to be. It turns out that we are not being pared up with another class mate and simply being assigned their design project, we have been put into groups of three and then have to work out ourselves which design we would work on.

It was all very easy to sort out however. We connected during class and then communicated by WhatsApp, exchanging briefs, and had a quick Zoom meeting. In my group were Kate and Yisha, and their projects were, respectively, a redesign of Lush's logo and Planty, a hypothetical app for identifying and caring for plants. I had no particular preference for either. It was Kate's slight interest in a plant-based project that got us organised. With Kate taking Yisha's, Yisha had to take mine and I had to take Kate's.

Read brief and looked into Lush at the same time.
