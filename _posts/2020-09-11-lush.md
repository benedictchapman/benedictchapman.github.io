In a bit of a surprise, getting the design brief I am going to work on is not as straight forward as I thought it was going to be. It turns out that we are not being pared up with another class mate and simply being assigned their design project, we have been put into groups of three and have to work out ourselves which design we would work on.

It was all very easy to sort out however. We connected during class and then communicated by WhatsApp, exchanging briefs, and had a quick Zoom meeting. In my group were Kate and Yisha, and their projects were, respectively, a redesign of Lush’s logo and Planty, a hypothetical app for identifying and caring for plants. I had no particular preference for either. It was Kate’s love of plants that got us organised. With Kate taking Yisha’s, Yisha had to take mine and I had to take Kate’s.

## Brief for redesign of Lush’s logo

The brief I received from Kate is for a redesign of Lush’s logo. Here is my summary of what is contained in the brief.

* Lush is a cosmetics company. Their products are handmade (whatever that means in this context), ethical, environmentally friendly and use fresh ingredients (again, the term “fresh” is open to interpretation).
* Lush has few competitors in the eco-friendly, ethical cosmetics field, though this is likely to change. Their current competitors include The Body Shop and Kiehl’s, most notably. However, the number of smaller producers using direct ecommerce platforms is growing.
* Lush’s point of difference is its six values: using fresh ingredients, being 100% vegetarian, ethical buying, handmade products, naked packaging and fighting animal testing.
* Lush’s primary audience is 20–30-year-old women with disposible income, though Lush deliberately do not target women or men specifically in their marketing.
* Lush do not use traditional advertising, as a policy.
* Lush want their logo redesigned with a softer look. Currently, Lush’s branding style is bold, both in colour and in font choice. The new design should be more approachable and less loud, and it should work with a softer palette. It needs to capture Lush’s values. In addition, it should be welcoming and present a “casual, helpful earthy and approachable tone”.
* The logo will be used on store signage, on product packaging and online. It needs to be print and web friendly.
* The current logo and wordmark are indeed bold. In both, “Lush” is displayed in all-caps Helvetica, in a weight beyond ‘bold’. In the samples provided ”Fresh handmade cosmetics” is included in both the logo and wordmark, in all-caps and in a font that resembles handwritten marker and bold Helvetica, respectively. (Samples included below.)
* The new logo should not follow the stereotype for organic-themed brands of using green or featuring plant life, while still demonstrating that they are ethical.
* The logo should contribute to helping users feel guilt-free in pampering themselves with Lush’s products. They should have confidence that Lush’s product are both friendly to the environment and their own bodies.
* Kate provides a series of references demonstrating Lush’s current branding and business practices, as well as some articles discussing the business of ethical cosmetics.

## Research and analysis

First off, Lush’s logo is definitely bold. At a glance, there is nothing in the logo that says organic to me
