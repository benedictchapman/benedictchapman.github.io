## Further research

We have a Lush store in town, so I popped in there while out shopping on the weekend:

* ![Lush instore signage]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lush-instore.jpg)
* ![Lush products]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lush-products.jpg)

I was encouraged to see that the roundness I saw all over the website also appeared in the store. The other thing that stood out was the use of white chalk marker on black. Also, just a lot of white on black in the store.

This visit firmed up my instinct of doing a hand written wordmark.

## Sketches

By this time I already had a picture of what I though I wanted in my head. And I needed to see what it looked like on paper.

So, before sketching, I was imagining very swoopy lettering. Clearly handwritten but not calligraphic. The idea here is to get something that looks natural and unpretentious. I wanted quite a lot of modulation in the lines (i.e. thicks and thins). This could be something that could, in theory at least, be drawn with a wedge-tip chalk marker. I was also very keen on it fitting within a stroke. In my head, that would give the words that much more *lusciousness*.

So, pencil in hand, I threw together some sketches. Firstly trying to get what was in head down on paper, then experimenting with different approaches and fiddling around with things. Below I am linking to scans of my sketches.

You can see from the progression from my first page to the last, I got close to nailing what I wanted on the first page. After a few tries at alternatives, I pretty much went back to my second sketch and had a go inking it.

Here are my second sketch, where I think I nailed the overall form (I say it was my second, but I did in fact erase and redraw it many time to get just the right shape) and it redrawn with modulation in the thickness and inked.

This nails the feelings I wanted in the logo. It feels natural. It is casual – jaunty even. Confident without being bold.

And something I love about it is that it expresses the letters elegantly. It think each letter is a beautiful work in itself. The L is of course dominant. But it doesn't overwhelm the other letters. My favourite shape is the s however. But mostly I love the way the letters work together. The L cups the u and the s and reaches out for the h. The u slips in to the crux of the L. The s has the space within the swoop of the foot of the L to reach out and perform its own beautiful swoop. The h slots in with the s and reaches out to the right, while also leaning back towards the other letters and forming the envelope that the whole things sits in.

(Could it maybe be mistaken for “Push” though? Something to be wary of.)

The next step is to digitise the pencil and ink sketch. I dig out my son's drawing tablet, opened Illustrator and traced the sketch using the Illustrator pencil tool. I wish I had saved a copy of my work at this point. I had what I needed to work with on the computer, my words made up of Illustrator paths, but it was so far away from the beautiful swoopy sketch I was trying to trace. I looked like I had drawn it with my left hand. With my eyes closed.

You know what comes next. Closing the paths, deleting excess anchor point and hours of meticulous adjusting of handles. Finally, I had three paths making up my letters.
