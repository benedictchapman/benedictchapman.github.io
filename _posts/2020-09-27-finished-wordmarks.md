The vast bulk of the work in creating the form of my final logo was done last week. This week involved some minor modifications, creating a compound object from the paths and then working with the stroke and other functions to form the final logos. This list of tasks might tive the impression that it is just finishing work, but it took as much, if not more effort than the previous week.

## Tweaks

There were a couple of things that I was slightly disappointed with in the form I had generated at the end of the last week.

Firstly, the narrowest parts of the logo were too narrow. When the outline was filled in, these narrows parts would represent where the pen that might have drawn the letters was drawing just a fine line. There were two problems with this. Firstly, I didn’t want to make it look like it been drawn with a pen. I didn’t want to make it look like it *wasn’t*, but I didn’t want that aspect of the line shape to be overt. Also, the logo might be reproduced at a small size, for which the thin lines might not be easily visible.

My second concern was that the flourish at the top of the L might be making it look subliminially like a P. While I did love the fine line of the flourish, I felt it had to be modified slightly to emphasise that it is a flouish.

This required further nudging of the anchor points and handles.

## Illustratoring

To get a file I could work with, I applied some Illustrator functions to the paths. To get rid of the crossing paths in the L and s, I appled the Minus Back pathfinder. Then, selected all of the paths from all of the letters and created a combined compound path.

Filling this in black created the first version of the wordmark:

## Stroke

Next I put a stroke around the letters. That is a simple process of increasing the ‘stroke’ for the path’s appearance. I applied the stroke to the outside of the path, with a round-join corner. Applying judgement to an appropriate size for the stroke, I made the width of the stroke about the width of the thicker parts of the u and h, just maybe a touch wider. I then used Outline Stroke to turn the stroke itself into the compound path. Then I could remove the hollows within the envelope (such as within the curve of the h).

I consider this to be the canonical version of the logo. The stroke adds opulance to the letters’ curves. I also love the white on black. Even without colour, the letters are vibrant within the stroke.

This form is also very welcoming of colour too, either in the letters or in the stroke. And this is an important point, as part of the stipulations of the brief is that Lush wants to use a softer palette. I tried out a range of colours and I think it works great. Even with a gradent.

## Funky Lush

I next experimented with an alternative stroke, one that gave the letters a 3D aspect. In this case I blended together the wordform and a spatially shifted copy of the wordform, then applied a stroke around that. It actually worked really nicely.

However, this gave the wordmark a grooviness that I didn’t think was appropriate for the brand. Although the curvy hand-written style I am using owes a lot to 70s’ styling, I tried to avoid making it look like it was from that era. So, I like this, but I am not using it.

## Lush circle

The last form of the logo was to put it in a circle. As I had always intended, the logo was supposed to mirror some of the shapes I had seen in the Lush store and website. The logo didn’t turn out to be terribly circular itself, but while I was creating it I had imagined it appearing in a circle. So this form is an important one to at least look at.

I suppose you could say that the plain version of the logo could just have a circle drawn around it. But I think it is important to actually apply that in a file. So I put a white logo within a black circle. Then I adjusted the position so that it looked centred, which actually meant the centre of the word was not at the centre of the circle.

The word looked slightly anaemic in the black circle. So I put a thin white stroke around it, which gave the overall form a better balance.

This form is an important addition to the range of logos. It can be used very effectively on round products. I can see it being used as a sticker to hold together the wrapping on a round piece of soap, for example. It is also useful as a Facebook or Twitter avatar picture.

## Three word marks

The instructions for the project are to provide three wordmarks. There were no specifications beyond that, so I have interpreted this in a way that I think is most appropriate for my logo. That is, I am providing three variations of the wordmark for use in different circumstances.

* The plain version of the logo consists of just the word. This might be used when it is displayed along with other words or in circumstances where the stroke version would look unnatural or cramped.
* The stroke version is intended to be used in most circumstances. It scales up and down sufficiently well that it can be used on awnings above stores and also on price stickers.
* The circular logo is for some specific cases where the stroke version will not work but the plain version is also lacking.

I can’t help but be concerned that my three choices here are quite similar. I do hope though that my description of the process by which I came up with them and the considerations that went into individually crafting them, detailed in this blog, do enough to explain why they should be considered important variations.
