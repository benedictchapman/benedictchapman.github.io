Now to put my logo into practice.

When I visited lush doing my research, I found that they wrapped their loose products such as soap in branded wrapping paper. They promote themselves as using “naked packaging”, which is clearly what this means. So I will have a go creating a design for wrapping paper that uses my logo.

So, taking a nice large sheet of A3, I randomly selected from my logo and icons representing fighting animal testing, ethical buying, vegetarian and handmade, taken from the Lush website, randomly determined an orientation and placed it on a grid.

So now I have three wordmarks and one collateral for submission. Whew. After the process of putting together my work for assignment 1, I was surprised that assignment 2 was worth more towards the final mark considering that it seemed to require less work. How wrong I was. And still I have to put together the pdf for submission. I had planned to put together a faux logo use guidelines document and will instead follow the assignment instructions and simply embed my files in a pdf.
